    <p>June 2021 - March 2022</p>
    <p>Virtual-Life was designed as the coursework element of my A-Level Computer Science course. It is a life simulator in which the main character, which can be either created by the player or by the program, grows up and experiences life. The player strives to pick correct decisions, when the game presents decisions to the player, as this will impact the 'Life-Score' which the main character is assigned when they die.</p>
    <p>This game was designed as a proto-type. Due to the time constraints placed on the A-Level project, it would have been impractical to construct a fully-fleshed out game in the time provided.</p>
    <p>This game was developed for Windows, using C# and the .NET Core framework.</p>
